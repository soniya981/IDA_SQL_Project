# Understanding IDA Funding: Insights from SQL Analysis
## Exploring IDA Funding with SQL
When countries don’t have enough resources to fund public services and infrastructure on their own, organizations like IDA step in to help. IDA provides low-interest loans and grants so countries can invest in things like education, health, energy, and infrastructure.
In this project, I used SQL to explore IDA financial data and understand where the money goes, how much is being used, and where problems might exist.
